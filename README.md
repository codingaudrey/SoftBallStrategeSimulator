# Softball Strategy Simulator
## About

Given an archetype of a hitter (ex, a power hitter who pulls balls to left field or a contact hitter who hits line drives up the center), find the optimal fielder positions such that you minimize the hitter's Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABiP). This tool simulates hitter archetypes and calculates outs based on fielder positioning.

## Usage
As of 10 March 2022, the project has reached the Alpha stage--basic usage is possible via directly editing main.py.
